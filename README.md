# Flight_Simulation
In this project, I have created a Flight Simulation using Python code. This is a 2D physics-based airplane flight simulator written in Python, modeling realistic aircraft dynamics including takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, and landing â€” all using real aerodynamics principles and numerical integration.

# Features 
The features of this project includes a full flight simulation, from takeoff to landing. This includes the four major forces acting on an airplane for the duration of the flight. They are Lift, Drag, Weight, And Thrust. Updating the postion and velocity of the place requires using The Runge-Kutta method and has realistic mass depletion. For visualization, I have used Metpltlib to output the altitude of the plane with respect to time.
